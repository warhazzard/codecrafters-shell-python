# 🐚 My Custom Shell (CodeCrafters Challenge - Phase 1)

Welcome! This project is my take on the [CodeCrafters Shell Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/shell) — building a **POSIX-compliant shell** from scratch using **Python**.

## 📜 About

This shell is designed to interpret and run shell commands, handle built-in commands (`cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.), and execute external programs, just like a typical Unix shell.

Right now, it supports:

- Running external programs
- Built-in commands like:
  - `exit`
  - `echo`
  - `type`
- A simple REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to interact with the shell

More features coming soon as I complete further stages of the challenge!

## 🛠 How to Run

First, make sure you have **Python 3.11** installed.

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
```

Run the shell:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

You’ll be dropped into a prompt where you can type commands!

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Launch external programs (like `ls`, `cat`, `grep`)
- ✅ Handle built-in commands (`cd`, `pwd`, `echo`)
- ✅ Basic error handling
- ✅ Simple REPL loop
- 🛠 More coming soon: piping (`|`), redirection (`>`, `<`), job control, scripting support!
